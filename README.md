# Stock Market Viewer

This is a simple stock prices viewing JFC/Swing-based desktop application that uses features from AWT API. It displays various stock prices (day's opening price, day's closing price, etc.) for enlisted organisations. The Wall Street Journalâ€™s API is used to fetch stock prices for different organisations. A Graph is displayed as a response when the user submits the request for stock prices of an organisation.
